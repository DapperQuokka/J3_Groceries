# J3_Groceries
HTML, JavaScript and CSS Website 2017 Summative Project

Created in a group of 3 developers for our grade 11 summative project.
Took 2 months to complete, without any prior knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript.
Our instructor left all the learning to the students.

This website handles and displays the catelogue of a fictional grocery chain that we designed, 
has interactive features like drop down menusand carousels. 

P.S The media account on the bottom link to actual profiles, but I recommend
you don't click on them... just a bunch of goofy 11th graders posting comments.

Thank you for checking this out!
